# Release Process

Follow these steps for every release. Do not skip steps.

## 1. Pre-Release Checks

```bash
rustup update stable                           # The latest stable Rust: CI and the release builds use it
cargo update                                   # Update dependencies first, so everything below tests them
cargo fmt --check                              # Code formatted
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings      # No warnings, tests included (as CI runs it)
cargo test                                     # Tests pass
cargo build --release                          # Release builds
cargo audit                                    # No security vulnerabilities
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps # The docs.rs pages build with no broken links
```

- [ ] CI is green on main, including "Coverage gate" (100% lines across Linux, macOS and Windows; see CONTRIBUTING.md "Coverage") and both "Nix" jobs (the flake builds proc and runs its tests in Nix's sandbox). A tag release does not wait for it. Locally: `scripts/coverage-local.sh`

### Cross-Platform Check

Code behind `#[cfg(unix)]` or `#[cfg(windows)]` (signals, `freeze`/`thaw`, lsof and netstat parsing) only compiles on its own platform, so a Unix-only import or helper breaks the Windows build with `-D warnings`. Always verify, tests included:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc  # One-time setup
cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --all-targets
```

### Oldest Supported Rust

`rust-version` in Cargo.toml is the oldest Rust that builds proc. It matters to people who build from source (`cargo install`, distro packages) and to library users; the prebuilt binaries don't depend on it. It is raised only when something proc builds needs a newer Rust:

- **When:** a dependency update needs a newer Rust (the highest `rust_version` among the dependencies goes above ours, or the check below fails), or we decide to use a language or standard-library feature that needs one and it is worth more than the way we have. Never because a new stable came out.
- **To what:** the lowest version that builds, which is the highest one the dependencies declare (command below) or the version that stabilized the feature. Never to the latest stable.
- **How:** in the same commit, `rust-version` in Cargo.toml, the version in CONTRIBUTING.md's prerequisites and in the commands below, and a CHANGELOG entry ("building from source needs Rust 1.NN"). Any release may carry it.

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.88 --profile minimal  # One-time setup, the version in Cargo.toml
cargo +1.88 check --all-targets                  # The declared floor still builds
# The highest Rust the dependencies declare; above ours means a raise
cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq -r '.packages[].rust_version // empty' | sort -V | tail -1
```

## 2. Manual Testing

Test new features manually with the release binary:

```bash
./target/release/proc --version    # e.g. "proc X.Y.Z-dev (main@abc1234, 3 commits after vX.Y.W, modified)"
./target/release/proc --help       # Verify help includes new commands
```

Before the tag exists, `--version` names the branch and commit: only a build of the release tag prints the plain `proc X.Y.Z` (build.rs; see "Automated Publishing" for how CI checks it). After the version bump in step 3 the version part must read the new version.

Test new commands/flags work as expected before releasing.

For a breaking release, also run a migration case for every **BREAKING** entry in the release's CHANGELOG section: the old usage must fail the way the entry says, and the new one must work. For 2.0.0 that was `proc by <part-of-name>` (exits 2; adding `--cmd` matches), `proc kill <pid> --json` (exits 4 with `needs_confirmation`) and `proc kill <pid> <pid> --dry-run` (previews both).

### Install path check (before tagging)

Version numbers alone don't prove a channel works. Install the npm package from a local tarball. Run this **before the version bump in step 3**: the installer downloads the binary for the version in `pkg/npm/package.json`, which at this point is the previous, already-published release, so this tests the installer itself:

```bash
cd pkg/npm && npm pack --pack-destination /tmp/proc-npm && cd -
mkdir -p /tmp/proc-npm/install && cd /tmp/proc-npm/install
npm install /tmp/proc-npm/proc-cli-*.tgz && ./node_modules/.bin/proc --version
```

Build and run the Docker image from the release tree too. The release workflow builds it the same way, from a context without `.git` (so it prints the plain version):

```bash
docker build -t proc-cli:release-check .
docker run --rm proc-cli:release-check --version
docker run --rm proc-cli:release-check list --json | head -5
docker rmi proc-cli:release-check
```

If anything here fails, fix it in this release, before the tag.

## 3. Version Bump

Update version in ALL of these files:
- [ ] `Cargo.toml` — version field
- [ ] `pkg/npm/package.json` — version field
- [ ] `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — `metadata.version` field
- [ ] `docs/_data/release.yml` — `version` field (the website's header, footer, install page and structured data read it)
- [ ] `Cargo.lock` — rebuild after the bump so its `proc-cli` entry changes, and commit it (`flake.nix` reads its version from `Cargo.toml` and its dependencies from `Cargo.lock`, so it needs no bump of its own)

`pkg/aur/PKGBUILD` is not bumped. Both AUR packages are community packages maintained by Rafael Dominiquini: `proc` (built from source) and `proc-bin` (the release binaries). The project has no AUR account yet, so the README points Arch users to his packages, and the PKGBUILD stays in the repo for the day the project can co-maintain them (see "After the tag: AUR" below).

## 4. Documentation

Update and verify all docs are complete:

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` — Rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` above it. Everything worked on since the last release is already listed there (see "Unreleased Work" in CLAUDE.md); check that it is complete. Update the links at the bottom: `[Unreleased]` compares `vX.Y.Z...HEAD`, and add `[X.Y.Z]` comparing the previous tag. Each heading (`### Added`, `### Fixed`, ...) appears once per release; merge any duplicates. Note every issue and PR the section references (`#n`): step 7 replies to them
- [ ] `docs/changelog.md` — Run `python3 scripts/changelog_site.py` after renaming the section: it writes the release into the website's changelog from CHANGELOG.md (never edit that part by hand; CI fails when the two differ)
- [ ] `README.md` — Review thoroughly: hero examples, Quick Start, Commands table, Filters table, Examples section all reflect new features
- [ ] `ROADMAP.md` — Remove everything this release shipped. The roadmap only holds what's still ahead (the CHANGELOG is the history)
- [ ] `src/lib.rs` — Review Rust docs: Features list, Quick Start examples, Commands list all reflect new features. Run `cargo doc --no-deps --open` to preview. This is what shows on docs.rs.
- [ ] `skills/proc-cli/SKILL.md` — Agent Skills: new commands, flags, schemas, playbooks (the "proc 2.0 or later" floor stays unless the skill needs a newer proc)
- [ ] `skills/proc-cli/evals.md` — if the skill's rules or playbooks changed in this release, run its tasks with the new SKILL.md loaded (a few paraphrases each, on a small model and a large one) and read the commands the agent ran; every Must met, no Must never. Add a task for any new rule
- [ ] `skills/proc-cli/reference.md` — JSON output schemas match actual output
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` — supported versions table (new major or minor line)
- [ ] `docs/commands/` — GitHub Pages: new command pages, index.md updated (its exit-code table matches the README's)
- [ ] The rest of the website: `docs/index.html`, `docs/install.md`, `docs/faq.md`, `docs/skill.md`, `docs/_data/`
- [ ] `pkg/npm/README.md` (the npm page) and the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` descriptions
- [ ] Every surface at once: for each entry in the release's CHANGELOG section, search all of the files above, `src/lib.rs` and the `--help` text for what the entry makes untrue (the old message, exit code or behaviour), and fix what is found. Check the search finds a known mention first
- [ ] Verify `proc manpage` output includes new commands
- [ ] Verify `proc completions` includes new commands

## 5. Commit & Tag

Stage the release files by path, not with `git add -A`: check `git status` first, because uncommitted work that isn't part of the release must stay out of it.

```bash
git status --short                       # only the release's files should be listed
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock CHANGELOG.md docs/changelog.md ...   # the files from steps 3 and 4
git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main vX.Y.Z              # main and this one tag (not --tags, which pushes every local tag)
```

The tag must be `v` + Cargo.toml's version: both the release and Docker workflows stop before publishing anything otherwise. A repository ruleset stops `v*` tags from being moved or deleted once pushed, and `main` from being force-pushed or deleted. If a tag must be redone because nothing was published from it, switch the tag ruleset off (Settings → Rules → Rulesets) for that one fix, then back on.

### After the tag: AUR

Nothing to publish: the AUR's `proc` and `proc-bin` are Rafael Dominiquini's. Step 7 checks that they caught up with the release. Once the project has an AUR account and co-maintains them, this step goes back to updating the AUR repositories with a PKGBUILD whose `sha256sums` is the tag tarball's checksum (`curl -fsSL https://github.com/yazeed/proc-cli/archive/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz | shasum -a 256`) and a regenerated `.SRCINFO` (`makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO` on Arch).

### After the tag: nixpkgs

nixpkgs builds proc from the tag, with its tests, as `proc-cli`. `pkg/nixpkgs/package.nix` is the file nixpkgs carries at `pkgs/by-name/pr/proc-cli/package.nix`, and every release moves it to the new version:

1. Set `version` in `pkg/nixpkgs/package.nix` and both `hash` and `cargoHash` to `lib.fakeHash`. Build it in the `nixos/nix` image (`pkg/nixpkgs/build.nix` builds it against the nixpkgs in `flake.lock`, with the maintainer entry nixpkgs may not have yet); the first build fails with the source hash it got, the second with the cargo hash. Put each in, then build once more: it runs the whole test suite and must pass.

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --cpus 4 -v "$PWD":/work -w /work -e NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes" \
     nixos/nix sh -c 'nix-build pkg/nixpkgs/build.nix && ./result/bin/proc --version'   # prints proc X.Y.Z
   ```

2. Commit `pkg/nixpkgs/package.nix` to `main`.
3. Bring it to nixpkgs, after the maintainer has seen the commit and the pull request text. Until the package is merged, the pull request on NixOS/nixpkgs (from the maintainer's fork) carries two commits, `maintainers: add yazeed` and `proc-cli: init at X.Y.Z`; each release updates it to the new version. Once it is merged, nixpkgs' update bot opens `proc-cli: A -> B` after a release: check its hashes match step 1 and its build passes, and approve it as the package's maintainer. nixpkgs asks commits written with an AI assistant to say so with an `Assisted-by:` trailer.

## 6. Verify CI

After tag push, monitor GitHub Actions:
- [ ] Build succeeds for all platforms, including each build's "Check the binary reports the tag's version" step
- [ ] Docker's "Check the tag matches Cargo.toml" step passes
- [ ] GitHub Release created with binaries
- [ ] crates.io published
- [ ] npm published
- [ ] Homebrew tap updated
- [ ] Scoop bucket updated
- [ ] Docker image pushed

## 7. Post-Release Verification

```bash
# Verify packages (after CI completes)
cargo install proc-cli                    # crates.io
npm info proc-cli version                 # npm
npm install --prefix /tmp/proc-npm-check proc-cli && /tmp/proc-npm-check/node_modules/.bin/proc --version  # npm installer works
brew update && brew info yazeed/proc/proc # Homebrew
brew upgrade yazeed/proc/proc && proc --version  # upgrades only proc, nothing else
docker pull yazeed/proc-cli               # Docker (the same image is also pushed as yazeed/proc)
nix run github:yazeed/proc-cli/vX.Y.Z -- --version  # Nix: builds the tag from the flake; prints proc X.Y.Z
# The same without Nix installed, in the nixos/nix image (afterwards: docker rmi nixos/nix, then the prunes in step 8)
docker run --rm -e NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes" nixos/nix nix run github:yazeed/proc-cli/vX.Y.Z -- --version

# nixpkgs: the open pull request (or, once merged, the update bot's) builds the new version and passes;
# after it reaches nixos-unstable, `nix run nixpkgs#proc-cli -- --version` prints proc X.Y.Z

# AUR (Rafael Dominiquini's packages): both should reach the new version within a few days
curl -s 'https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc/v5/info?arg[]=proc&arg[]=proc-bin' | jq -r '.results[] | "\(.Name) \(.Version)"'

# Linux binaries are static (musl): they must run on an older distro and on Alpine
mkdir -p /tmp/proc-linux && cd /tmp/proc-linux
curl -fsSL https://github.com/yazeed/proc-cli/releases/latest/download/proc-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
curl -fsSL https://github.com/yazeed/proc-cli/releases/latest/download/proc-linux-aarch64.tar.gz | tar xz
for img in debian:bullseye-slim alpine; do
  docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 -v "$PWD":/w $img /w/proc-linux-x86_64 --version
  docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 -v "$PWD":/w $img /w/proc-linux-aarch64 --version
done
cd -

# Agent skill: skills.sh doesn't watch the repo, and there's no refresh command. It re-reads
# main when the skill is installed with telemetry on (no DISABLE_TELEMETRY / DO_NOT_TRACK):
# on 2026-10-27 one install updated its stored copy and page within minutes. An install on
# 2026-10-25, about an hour after its previous refresh, changed nothing; why is unknown.
mkdir -p /tmp/proc-skill-check && cd /tmp/proc-skill-check
bunx skills add yazeed/proc-cli --skill proc-cli -a claude-code -y   # installs into this folder only
cd - && rm -rf /tmp/proc-skill-check

# Is skills.sh's stored copy current? Prints "current" when its SKILL.md matches main's
curl -s https://skills.sh/api/download/yazeed/proc-cli/proc-cli \
  | uv run python -c 'import json,sys; f={x["path"]:x["contents"] for x in json.load(sys.stdin)["files"]}; print("current" if f["SKILL.md"]==open("skills/proc-cli/SKILL.md").read() else "stale")'
```

Also verify:
- [ ] https://docs.rs/proc-cli — Rust docs updated
- [ ] https://proc-cli.com/install — the header pill and the install page show the new version (GitHub Pages rebuilds a minute or two after the push)
- [ ] `proc --version` — prints exactly `proc X.Y.Z` from every channel (no `-dev`, no commit), Nix included (the `nix run` line above)
- [ ] `flake.lock` — refresh it when it has gone stale or a build needs a newer nixpkgs (`nix flake update`, then `nix flake check -L`; without Nix installed, run both in the `nixos/nix` Docker image with `NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"`). Commit it with the next change; the Nix jobs in CI check it on every push
- [ ] `proc manpage` — Includes new commands
- [ ] `proc completions bash` — Includes new commands
- [ ] skills.sh is current: the check above prints `current` (the page at https://www.skills.sh/yazeed/proc-cli/proc-cli is cached for up to 5 minutes). If it's stale, run the install again the next day. If that doesn't help either, ask for a refresh with an issue on [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills/issues), which runs skills.sh; many such requests there are unanswered. Agents installing the skill are unaffected either way: `skills add` reads the current SKILL.md from GitHub

### Reply to what the release fixed

Once every channel above checks out, answer each issue and PR the release's CHANGELOG section references (`#n`, noted in step 4):

- [ ] Rerun the reporter's steps on the released build and quote the result in the reply
- [ ] Say what changed, link the commits, and name the version and how to upgrade
- [ ] Close fixed issues as *completed* (`gh issue close <n> --reason completed --comment ...`). Fix commits reference issues as `(#n)`, not `Fixes #n`, so nothing closes before the release is out
- [ ] Thank the people who reported and contributed by name

## 8. Cleanup

```bash
cargo clean               # Remove build artifacts (~10GB+ after a release session)
docker builder prune -f   # Build cache from the Docker checks in steps 2 and 7
docker image prune -f     # Dangling images left by those builds
```

---

## Automated Publishing

On tag push, GitHub Actions handles:

1. **Build**: Cross-compile for all platforms. Each build then checks its binary: no `-dev` marker, and the targets the runner can execute must print exactly `proc <tag version>`. Every publish job below needs this job, so a mislabelled binary or a tag that doesn't match Cargo.toml publishes nothing
2. **GitHub Release**: Create release with binaries
3. **crates.io**: Publish with `--allow-dirty`
4. **npm**: Publish proc-cli package
5. **Homebrew**: Update yazeed/homebrew-proc tap
6. **Scoop**: Update yazeed/scoop-bucket-proc bucket
7. **Docker**: Push to yazeed/proc-cli on Docker Hub, and the same build to yazeed/proc (the image's original name). A separate workflow (`docker.yml`) with its own tag check: it stops if the tag isn't `v` + Cargo.toml's version

Nix has nothing to publish: the flake lives in the repository, so `nix run github:yazeed/proc-cli/vX.Y.Z` works as soon as the tag is pushed, and CI's Nix jobs have already built and tested the flake on main. The nixpkgs package (`nix run nixpkgs#proc-cli`) is moved to each release by hand until it is merged, and by the nixpkgs update bot after (see "After the tag: nixpkgs").

Third-party actions in `release.yml` and `docker.yml` are pinned to commit SHAs, with the version in a comment, because those jobs hold the publishing tokens. To update one, resolve the new tag's commit (`gh api repos/<owner>/<action>/commits/<tag> --jq .sha`) and change the SHA and the comment together.

## Required Secrets

Configure in GitHub repo settings → Secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | PAT for homebrew-proc repo |
| `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN` | PAT for scoop-bucket-proc repo |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub access token |

npm and crates.io need no secret. Both publish through **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**:
- **npm:** configured on npmjs.com under `proc-cli` → Settings → Trusted Publisher: GitHub Actions, `yazeed` / `proc-cli`, workflow `release.yml`, no environment, **Allow npm publish** checked. The `publish-npm` job needs `id-token: write` and npm 11.5.1 or newer.
- **crates.io:** configured under the `proc-cli` crate → Settings → Trusted Publishing: GitHub, `yazeed` / `proc-cli`, workflow `release.yml`, no environment.

If the repository or the workflow file is renamed, both trusted publishers must be recreated. A new npm trusted publisher expires unless a publish succeeds within 2 days, so add it shortly before tagging.

## Package Distribution

| Channel | Package Name | Install Command |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| crates.io | proc-cli | `cargo install proc-cli` |
| npm | proc-cli | `npm install -g proc-cli` |
| Homebrew | proc | `brew install yazeed/proc/proc` |
| Scoop | proc | `scoop bucket add proc https://github.com/yazeed/scoop-bucket-proc && scoop install proc` |
| Docker | yazeed/proc-cli (also yazeed/proc) | `docker run yazeed/proc-cli` |
| Nix (flake in this repo) | proc-cli | `nix profile install github:yazeed/proc-cli` |
| AUR (community, Rafael Dominiquini) | proc, proc-bin | `yay -S proc` (from source), `yay -S proc-bin` (release binary) |
