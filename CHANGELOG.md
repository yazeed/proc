## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-12

Initial public release.

### Commands

All commands accept **targets**: `:port`, `PID`, or `name` where applicable.

**Discovery** (nouns — observe state)
- `proc on <target>` — Bidirectional port/process lookup
  - `:port` → What process is using this port?
  - `PID` → What ports is this process using?
  - `name` → What ports are these processes using?
- `proc ports` — List all listening ports
- `proc ps [name]` — List processes (filter by name, path, or resources)
- `proc info <target>` — Detailed process information
- `proc tree [target]` — Process hierarchy view
- `proc stuck` — Find hung processes

**Lifecycle** (verbs — change state)
- `proc kill <target>` — Force kill (SIGKILL)
- `proc stop <target>` — Graceful stop (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after timeout)
- `proc unstick [target]` — Attempt to recover stuck processes
  - Tries SIGCONT → SIGINT recovery sequence
  - Use `--force` to terminate if recovery fails

### Features

- **Unified targets**: Most commands accept `:port`, `PID`, or process `name`
- **Path filtering**: `--cwd` and `--path` filters for `proc ps`
- **Resource filtering**: `--min-cpu`, `--min-mem`, `--status` filters for `ps` and `tree`
- **Bidirectional lookup**: `proc on` works both ways (port→process and process→ports)
- **Cross-platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
- **Output formats**: Colored terminal output, JSON (`--json`) for scripting
- **Safety**: Confirmation prompts before destructive actions

### Principles

- **Semantic**: Commands mean what they say
- **Explicit**: User intent must be clear
- **Complete**: Cover the full workflow, nothing more
- **Fast**: Sub-100ms for all operations
- **Obvious**: If you have to read the docs, we failed

### Values

- **Unified targets**: `:port`, `PID`, and `name` work the same way everywhere
- **Natural grammar**: Nouns to observe, verbs to act
- **Practical simplicity**: Every feature solves a real, repeated problem
- **Easy to remember**: Consistent patterns—know one command, know them all
