## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Tier 3 distribution channels**:
  - **Scoop** (Windows): `pkg/scoop/proc.json` manifest with auto-update
  - **AUR** (Arch Linux): `pkg/aur/PKGBUILD` for `yay -S proc`
  - **npm** wrapper: `pkg/npm/` for `npm install -g proc-cli`
  - **Nix flake**: `flake.nix` for `nix profile install github:yazeed/proc`

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-21


### Added

- **cargo-binstall support**: `cargo binstall proc-cli` now downloads pre-built binaries
  - 10x faster than `cargo install` (no compilation required)
  - Configured for all platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows (Intel and ARM)
- **Docker Hub automation**: Images automatically published on release
  - Multi-arch support: linux/amd64, linux/arm64
  - Available at `docker run yazeed/proc`

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- Enhanced `--version` output to include repository URL and license

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **ARGS column** in `proc list` output showing command arguments
  - Displays script names for Python/Node processes (e.g., `daily_spread_trader.py`)
  - Simplifies paths to filenames for readability
  - Enables finding processes by script name: `proc list my_script.py`

### Changed

- Reorganized `proc list` columns: PID, PATH, NAME, ARGS, CPU%, MEM, STATUS
- Improved process identification for interpreted languages (Python, Node, Ruby, etc.)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-14

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Renamed `ps` command to `list` for better semantics
  - `ps` remains as an alias for backwards compatibility
- Updated tagline: "Semantic CLI tool for process management. Target by port, process id (PID), name or path."

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- Streamlined README with cleaner structure and code-first approach
- Added Targets section explaining unified `:port`, `PID`, `name` syntax
- Removed "Why proc?" comparison section

### Fixed

- Fixed README filter table incorrectly stating `--in` and `--path` work with `tree` (ps-only)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Fixed outdated error message suggesting removed `proc find --all` command
- Fixed `--cwd` references in help text and documentation (renamed to `--in`)
- Fixed JSON output action field from "find" to "ps"

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-12

Initial public release.

### Commands

All commands accept **targets**: `:port`, `PID`, or `name` where applicable.

**Discovery** (nouns — observe state)
- `proc on <target>` — Bidirectional port/process lookup
  - `:port` → What process is using this port?
  - `PID` → What ports is this process using?
  - `name` → What ports are these processes using?
- `proc ports` — List all listening ports
- `proc ps [name]` — List processes (filter by name, path, or resources)
- `proc info <target>` — Detailed process information
- `proc tree [target]` — Process hierarchy view
- `proc stuck` — Find hung processes

**Lifecycle** (verbs — change state)
- `proc kill <target>` — Force kill (SIGKILL)
- `proc stop <target>` — Graceful stop (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after timeout)
- `proc unstick [target]` — Attempt to recover stuck processes
  - Tries SIGCONT → SIGINT recovery sequence
  - Use `--force` to terminate if recovery fails

### Features

- **Unified targets**: Most commands accept `:port`, `PID`, or process `name`
- **Path filtering**: `--in` and `--path` filters for `proc ps`
- **Resource filtering**: `--min-cpu`, `--min-mem`, `--status` filters for `ps` and `tree`
- **Bidirectional lookup**: `proc on` works both ways (port→process and process→ports)
- **Cross-platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), Linux (x86_64, ARM64), Windows (x86_64)
- **Output formats**: Colored terminal output, JSON (`--json`) for scripting
- **Safety**: Confirmation prompts before destructive actions

### Principles

- **Semantic**: Commands mean what they say
- **Explicit**: User intent must be clear
- **Complete**: Cover the full workflow, nothing more
- **Fast**: Sub-100ms for all operations
- **Obvious**: If you have to read the docs, we failed

### Values

- **Unified targets**: `:port`, `PID`, and `name` work the same way everywhere
- **Natural grammar**: Nouns to observe, verbs to act
- **Practical simplicity**: Every feature solves a real, repeated problem
- **Easy to remember**: Consistent patterns—know one command, know them all
