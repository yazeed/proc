  Port/Process Lookup:
    proc on :3000                  What's on port 3000?
    proc on :3000 :8080            What's on several ports?
    proc on node                   What ports are the processes named node using?

  Find by File:
    proc for ./server              Processes running this program (or holding it open)
    proc for /usr/bin/node         Processes running this executable
    proc for app.log               What has this file open? (not searched on Windows)

  Filter by Name:
    proc by node                   Processes named 'node' (the whole name)
    proc by node --cmd             Anything with 'node' in its name or command line
    proc by node --in .            Node processes in current directory

    proc info :3000 :8080          Info for several targets
    proc kill :3000 node           Kill port 3000 and the processes named node
    proc kill serve --cmd          Kill processes with 'serve' in their command line

    proc watch -n 1 --sort mem     1s refresh, sorted by memory
    proc watch --in . --by node    Node processes in current directory

  Freeze/Thaw:
    proc freeze node               Pause the processes named node (SIGSTOP)
    proc freeze :3000 --yes        Freeze by port, skip confirm
    proc thaw node                 Resume frozen processes (SIGCONT)

  Free Ports:
    proc free :3000                Kill process, verify port freed
