//! `proc stuck` - Find stuck/hung processes
//!
//! A process counts as stuck when it has been running longer than --timeout and,
//! in two readings a second apart, is using more than 50% CPU or is blocked in
//! uninterruptible sleep. A long build at full CPU looks the same as a loop
//! that never ends, so check the list before --kill.
//!
//! Examples:
//!   proc stuck              # Running over 5 minutes, and busy or blocked for 2 seconds
//!   proc stuck --timeout 60 # The same, for processes running over 1 minute
//!   proc stuck --kill       # Find and kill stuck processes
//!   proc stuck --by node    # Only those named node (--cmd: node anywhere in the command line)
