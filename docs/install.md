The latest version is **{{ site.data.release.version }}** ([what's new](changelog)). Every method below installs the same single binary, called `proc`.

## macOS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). The command adds the `yazeed/proc` tap for you.

```bash
brew install yazeed/proc/proc
```

Or with the install script, which downloads the release binary for your Mac:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yazeed/proc-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Linux

The install script works on any distribution, including Alpine and older releases such as Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20.04, because the binaries are static:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yazeed/proc-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

Homebrew on Linux works too: `brew install yazeed/proc/proc`.

## Windows

With [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

```bash
scoop bucket add proc https://github.com/yazeed/scoop-bucket-proc
scoop install proc
```

## Any platform

### npm or bun

The package downloads the binary for your platform the first time you run `proc`, and checks its SHA-256 checksum.

```bash
npm install -g proc-cli
bun install -g proc-cli
```

### Cargo

From source with [Rust](https://rustup.rs), or as a pre-built binary with [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```bash
cargo install proc-cli
cargo binstall proc-cli
```

### Nix

```bash
nix profile install github:yazeed/proc-cli
```

### Docker

`--pid=host` lets proc see the host's processes, and `--net=host` its ports (for `on :port`, `ports` and `free`).

```bash
docker run --rm -it --pid=host --net=host yazeed/proc-cli
```

## Check it works

```bash
proc --version
proc ports
```

## Teach your coding agent

The [agent skill](skill) teaches Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others when to reach for proc:

```bash
npx skills add yazeed/proc-cli
```

## Shell completions

```bash
proc completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/proc          # bash
proc completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_proc               # zsh
proc completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/proc.fish  # fish
```

## Man page

```bash
proc manpage | sudo tee /usr/local/share/man/man1/proc.1 > /dev/null
man proc
```
