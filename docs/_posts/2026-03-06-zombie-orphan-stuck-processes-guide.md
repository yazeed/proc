Your process will not die. You have run `kill` twice, maybe three times. Or `ps` is showing a state you do not recognize -- something with a `Z` or a `D` in the STAT column. You are not sure whether to escalate or wait.

Here is what is actually happening, and what to do about it.

## Process states explained

Every process on a Unix system is in one of a handful of states at any given moment. You can see them with `ps aux`:

```
USER   PID  %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS  STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root     1   0.0  0.1 169312 13092 Ss   Feb28   0:08 /sbin/init
zee   4821   2.3  1.4 982340 11520 Sl   10:02   0:45 node server.js
zee   5190   0.0  0.0      0     0 Z    10:15   0:00 [build] <defunct>
root   312   0.1  0.0      0     0 D    09:58   0:12 [nfsd]
zee   6700   0.0  0.2 225880  3200 T    10:30   0:01 vim notes.txt
```

The STAT column is the one that matters here. The first character tells you the process state:

**R -- Running.** The process is on a CPU or in the run queue waiting for one. This is the normal "doing work" state.

**S -- Sleeping (interruptible).** The process is waiting for something -- a network packet, user input, a timer. This is the most common state. It can be woken by a signal. The vast majority of processes on your system are in this state right now.

**D -- Uninterruptible sleep.** The process is waiting on I/O and *cannot be interrupted*. Not by you, not by `kill -9`, not by anything except the I/O completing. More on this below.

**T -- Stopped.** The process received SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z in a terminal) or SIGSTOP. It is frozen in place but still alive. Its memory is intact. It can be resumed.

**Z -- Zombie.** The process has finished executing. It is dead. But its entry remains in the process table because its parent has not acknowledged the exit. This is the one that confuses people most.

The second and subsequent characters in STAT are modifiers: `s` means session leader, `l` means multithreaded, `+` means foreground process group, `<` means high priority, `N` means low priority. These are informational -- the first character is the state that matters for debugging.

## Zombie processes

A zombie process is not running. It is not consuming CPU. It is not using memory (beyond a few bytes for its process table entry). It is, in every meaningful sense, dead.

So why is it still showing up in `ps`?

### How processes exit in Unix

When a process finishes, the kernel does not immediately remove it from the process table. Instead, the kernel keeps a small record: the process's PID, its exit status, and some resource usage statistics. This record exists so that the *parent process* can retrieve it.

The parent retrieves this information by calling `wait()` or `waitpid()`. This is called "reaping" the child. Until the parent calls `wait()`, the child remains in the process table as a zombie.

This is by design. The exit status of a child process is important information. If the kernel deleted it immediately, the parent would have no way to know whether its child succeeded or failed.

### How to find zombies

The direct approach:

```bash
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /Z/'
```

This filters `ps aux` output where column 8 (the STAT column) matches the pattern `/Z/`. The `~` operator in awk means "matches regex." You will see output like:

```
zee   5190  0.0  0.0      0  0 Z+   10:15   0:00 [build] <defunct>
```

Note the `<defunct>` tag -- that is `ps` telling you this is a zombie.

For more detail, including the parent PID:

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,comm | awk '$3 ~ /Z/'
```

```
  PID  PPID STAT COMMAND
 5190  4821 Z+   build
```

Now you know the zombie's PID (5190) and its parent's PID (4821). The parent PID is the key piece of information.

### Can you kill a zombie?

No. You cannot kill what is already dead. Running `kill -9 5190` on a zombie does nothing. The process has already exited. There is nothing left to signal.

What you need to do is get the *parent* to reap the zombie. You have two options:

**Option 1: Signal the parent to reap its children.**

```bash
kill -SIGCHLD <parent_pid>
```

SIGCHLD is the signal the kernel sends to a parent when a child exits. Sending it manually can nudge a parent that has a signal handler but has not gotten around to calling `wait()`. This works when the parent is well-behaved but slow.

**Option 2: Kill the parent.**

```bash
kill <parent_pid>
```

When the parent dies, the zombie is reparented to PID 1 (init or systemd). PID 1 is specifically designed to reap orphaned zombies. It calls `wait()` in a loop. The zombie will be cleaned up almost immediately.

This is the nuclear option, but it is sometimes the only one. If the parent is ignoring SIGCHLD or has a bug in its wait logic, no amount of signaling will fix it.

### When to worry about zombies

A handful of zombies are normal and harmless. They take up one slot in the process table (a PID) and a few bytes of kernel memory. On modern systems with PID limits in the tens of thousands, this is nothing.

*Thousands* of zombies are a problem. They indicate a parent process that is spawning children and never reaping them. Eventually this can exhaust the PID space, preventing new processes from being created. If you see zombie counts climbing, the fix is to find and fix (or restart) the buggy parent.

## Orphan processes

An orphan is the inverse of a zombie. Where a zombie is a dead child with a living parent, an orphan is a living child whose parent has died.

### What happens when a parent exits

When a process exits, all of its children are "reparented" to PID 1. The kernel walks the exiting process's children and sets their parent PID to 1. PID 1 (init, systemd, or launchd on macOS) adopts them.

This is not inherently a problem. In fact, it is a deliberate Unix pattern.

### The double fork

Daemons use this intentionally. The classic double-fork pattern works like this:

1. Original process forks a child.
2. Child forks a grandchild.
3. Child exits immediately (becomes a zombie, quickly reaped by original process).
4. Grandchild is now orphaned, reparented to PID 1.
5. Grandchild continues running as a daemon, detached from any terminal.

This is how processes intentionally become background services. So not every process with PPID 1 is a problem.

### How to find orphans

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,comm | awk '$2 == 1'
```

This finds every process whose parent PID is 1. But the output will include legitimate system services, daemons, and anything launched by your init system. You need context to tell the difference.

Suspicious orphans are usually:

- Processes with names matching development tools (node, python, ruby, webpack, esbuild)
- Processes whose working directory is inside a project folder
- Processes that have been running since you last restarted a dev server

### When orphans are a problem

The most common case in development: you start a process that spawns children, then kill the parent without the children getting the signal. The children keep running, holding onto ports and consuming resources, and you have no obvious way to find them because the parent is gone.

Build tools are frequent offenders. A webpack-dev-server might spawn file watchers. A test runner might spawn worker processes. If you kill the parent with `kill -9` (which cannot be caught or forwarded), the children are orphaned.

This is why `kill -9` should be a last resort, not a reflex. `SIGTERM` gives the parent a chance to clean up its children. `SIGKILL` does not.

## Stuck processes (uninterruptible sleep)

The D state is the most frustrating situation you can encounter, because there is almost nothing you can do about it from userspace.

### What D state means

When a process enters uninterruptible sleep, it is waiting on an I/O operation that the kernel cannot safely interrupt. The most common case is a disk read or write that has been submitted to the hardware. The kernel has committed to completing this operation -- the process's data structures are in a state that cannot be rolled back.

This is different from interruptible sleep (S), where the kernel can wake the process with a signal, let it handle the signal, and resume. In D state, the process is in the middle of something that must complete atomically.

### How to find D-state processes

```bash
ps aux | awk '$8 == "D"'
```

Or to catch variant states like `D+` or `Ds`:

```bash
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /D/'
```

If this returns results, you have processes stuck in I/O waits.

### Can you kill a D-state process?

No. Not with `kill -9`. Not with anything. SIGKILL is delivered by the kernel, and the kernel will not deliver signals to a process in uninterruptible sleep. The signal is queued, and it will be delivered *when the I/O completes*. If the I/O never completes, the signal is never delivered.

This is the one case where Unix process management genuinely cannot help you.

### Common causes

**Stale NFS mounts.** By far the most common cause. If an NFS server goes down or the network path to it is broken, any process accessing that mount will enter D state and stay there. The fix is to resolve the NFS issue -- bring the server back, fix the network, or force-unmount the stale mount with `umount -f` or `umount -l` (lazy unmount).

**Disk hardware failure.** If the underlying storage device is failing, I/O requests may never complete. The kernel is waiting for a response from hardware that cannot respond.

**Kernel driver bugs.** A driver that never completes an I/O request will leave processes stuck in D state. This is most common with third-party filesystem drivers or storage controllers.

**FUSE filesystems.** A FUSE daemon that has crashed or hung will leave any process that was accessing the filesystem in D state, since the kernel is waiting for the FUSE daemon to respond.

### What to do

1. **Identify what the process is waiting on.** On Linux, check `/proc/<pid>/wchan` to see the kernel function it is blocked in, and `/proc/<pid>/stack` for the full kernel stack trace.
2. **Fix the underlying I/O issue.** Bring the NFS server back, unmount the stale filesystem, restart the FUSE daemon.
3. **If nothing else works, reboot.** This is sometimes the only option for D-state processes. It is not satisfying, but it is reality.

### Stopped processes (T state)

Stopped processes are much simpler. A process in T state received SIGTSTP (usually from Ctrl+Z in a terminal) or SIGSTOP (which cannot be caught). It is frozen but alive.

To resume a stopped process:

```bash
kill -CONT <pid>
```

Or, if it is the most recently stopped job in your current shell:

```bash
fg
```

Stopped processes are not stuck. They are waiting for you to tell them to continue. But if you forget about them, they sit in the process table consuming memory indefinitely.

## The systematic approach

When you suspect problem processes, here is a step-by-step method:

**Step 1: Find them.**

```bash
ps aux | awk '$8 ~ /Z|D|T/' | head -20
```

This filters for zombies, uninterruptible sleep, and stopped processes in one pass. The regex `Z|D|T` matches any of the three problem states.

**Step 2: Check the parent.**

For each problem process, find who spawned it:

```bash
ps -o ppid= -p <pid>
```

The `ppid=` syntax (with the trailing `=`) suppresses the header, giving you just the parent PID. This tells you whether the problem is in the process itself or in the process that created it.

**Step 3: Investigate what it is waiting on (Linux).**

```bash
# What kernel function is it blocked in?
cat /proc/<pid>/wchan

# What files does it have open?
ls -la /proc/<pid>/fd

# Full kernel stack trace (requires root)
cat /proc/<pid>/stack
```

On macOS, the equivalent is `sudo sample <pid>` or `sudo spindump <pid>`.

**Step 4: Act based on state.**

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Z (zombie) | Signal or kill the parent. The zombie itself is already dead. |
| D (uninterruptible) | Fix the I/O issue. Cannot be killed. May require reboot. |
| T (stopped) | `kill -CONT <pid>` to resume, or kill it if unwanted. |

## proc's approach

[proc](https://github.com/yazeed/proc) has two built-in commands for this: `proc stuck` finds problem processes, and `proc unstick` attempts to recover them.

Find all stuck processes (default threshold is 5 minutes):

```bash
proc stuck
```

```
! Found 3 potentially stuck processes:

  -> node [PID 4821] - 98.2% CPU, running for 2h 15m
  -> webpack [PID 4830] - 87.5% CPU, running for 2h 15m
  -> python [PID 6012] - 0.0% CPU, running for 45m
```

Attempt recovery with escalating signals (SIGCONT, then SIGINT):

```bash
proc unstick
```

If gentle recovery does not work, `--force` escalates through SIGTERM and SIGKILL:

```bash
proc unstick --force
```

You can also target specific processes by PID, port, or name:

```bash
proc unstick :3000           # Unstick process on port 3000
proc unstick node --in .     # Unstick node processes in current directory
proc stuck --by webpack      # Find stuck webpack processes
```

Both commands support `--dry-run`, `--json`, and `--yes` for scripting.
