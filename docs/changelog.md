<!-- From CHANGELOG.md by scripts/changelog_site.py: edit CHANGELOG.md, not this part -->

## 2.1.0 — 2026-10-30

**Added**

- **Nix is a checked install method.** `nix run github:yazeed/proc-cli` runs proc without installing it, and `nix profile install github:yazeed/proc-cli` installs it with its man page and its bash, zsh and fish completions. `flake.nix` had no lock file (each install used that day's nixpkgs), hard-coded the version, and no workflow built it; it now reads the version from `Cargo.toml`, ships a `flake.lock` pinned to nixpkgs-unstable, and declares Linux and macOS on Intel and Apple silicon (CI checks x86_64 Linux and Apple-silicon macOS). `nix flake check` builds proc from `Cargo.lock` and runs the whole test suite in Nix's build sandbox, and CI does that on Ubuntu and macOS on every push, then runs the built `proc --version`. The package is named `proc-cli` and the program `proc`. Two tests assumed the machine they ran on: one started `sleep` under another name, which fails where `sleep` is one name of a multi-call `coreutils` (Nix's), and the whole-machine `tree` test wanted two processes side by side, which a sandbox with one chain of processes does not have; both now hold anywhere. The nixpkgs package (`nix run nixpkgs#proc-cli`) is still to come
- **`--start-time` acts on a PID only while it belongs to the process you saw.** The OS gives a PID to a new process once the old one exits, and on a busy Mac every PID comes around again in well under an hour (2,700 new PIDs a minute measured on one developer machine, with PIDs up to 99,999). An agent that recorded a PID and acted on it later could end someone else's process: `--by` and `--in` only catch a new process with another name or directory, and comparing `start_time` by hand happens before the action, not at it. `proc stop 1234 --start-time 1700000000 --yes` now acts only if PID 1234's process started then (to the second); otherwise it exits 2 with `(ruled out by --start-time 1700000000)`. The value is the `start_time` in the process's JSON. It takes one PID target (anything else is exit 4), and a process whose start time can't be read (on macOS, another user's) is ruled out rather than trusted. On `kill`, `stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `wait`, `info` and `unstick`. The skill's rules 1 and 7 and its playbooks use it, and `evals.md` has a task for a reused PID (14). A guard error now names only the guards that ruled the process out, so `--by sleep --start-time 1` on a `sleep` names the start time alone. **Library API:** `guard_targets` takes a `Guards` (`in_dir`, `by_name`, `start_time`), and the seven commands' structs have a `start_time` field

**Changed**

- **Every JSON error says why in `reason`.** `reason` came only with exit 4, so an agent could branch on why nothing was done but had to read prose for every other failure, and exit 2 alone meant three things: the target is gone, the name is only in command lines (`--cmd` would match), or a guard ruled the process out (Jeff de Vries, an iLands agent, and Wisp both asked for a field to branch on). Every error now carries one fixed word: `system_error` (exit 1); `not_found`, `command_line_only` or `ruled_out` (exit 2); `permission_denied` (exit 3); and, as before, `invalid_input`, `needs_confirmation` or `not_supported` (exit 4). A `ruled_out` error also has `ruled_out_by`, the flags of the guards that ruled the process out (`["--start-time"]`), and its text names them with their values on every command, `on` and `tree` included: `on` said "not in specified directory" even when `--by` was the guard that failed. A result that did not fully succeed (`failed` entries, `freed: false`, a `wait` that timed out) is not an error and has no `reason`. A port whose holders all ended between listing it and looking them up is now exit 2 (`not_found`), not exit 1. **Library API:** `ProcError::reason()` returns a reason for every error except `Reported`; new constants `REASON_SYSTEM_ERROR`, `REASON_NOT_FOUND`, `REASON_COMMAND_LINE_ONLY`, `REASON_RULED_OUT` and `REASON_PERMISSION_DENIED`; `ProcError::FilteredOut` has `ruled_out_by: Vec<(String, String)>` in place of `reason: String`, and `ProcError::ruled_out_by()` returns its flags; `proc_cli::core::ruled_out_by` names the guards that rule out a list of processes; `ProcessGone` exits 2
- **The website's changelog is written from CHANGELOG.md.** A release's notes were copied into `docs/changelog.md` by hand, with the website's headings. `scripts/changelog_site.py` now writes every release newer than the website's own history from CHANGELOG.md, and CI fails when the two differ, so a release's notes are written once
- **The agent skill reads a guard's exit 2 for what it is** (rule 7): a plain not-found means the PID is gone, while "ruled out by" means a process holds the PID and fails the guard, so the agent checks it with `proc info` before moving on. `evals.md` has a task for it (13)
- **The agent skill searches a name unscoped first.** Its "Stop something you did not start" playbook began with `proc kill <name> --in=<dir> --dry-run --json`, and in one of four eval runs an agent asked to "clean up node processes" scoped that first look to its own project directory and never showed the user the machine-wide matches. The playbook now searches without `--in`, tells the user how many processes match and what they are, and adds `--in=<dir>` only once the user names the directory
- **The agent skill no longer tells an agent to run a raw URL.** Its install line ended with `scoop bucket add proc https://github.com/...`, which Snyk's skills.sh audit flagged after 2.0.2 as an unverifiable runtime dependency (W012). The line keeps the registry installs (`brew`, `cargo`, `npm`, the last two also on Windows) and points to the README for Scoop and the rest
- **The README lists the AUR's `proc` package next to `proc-bin`.** Rafael Dominiquini, who maintains `proc-bin` (the release binaries), now also packages proc built from source as `proc` (`yay -S proc`)
- **The package listings name what proc is for.** crates.io and npm show https://proc-cli.com as the homepage (they showed the GitHub repo), and so do the Homebrew formula and the Scoop manifest. The crates.io keywords are now `kill, lsof, port, process, eaddrinuse` (`management`, `pid` and `cli` were generic or already in the name and description), with `development-tools` next to `command-line-utilities`. The npm keywords add the tools and errors people search for (`kill-port`, `lsof`, `taskkill`, `pkill`, `netstat`, `eaddrinuse`)

**Fixed**

- **The man page's title line names only the version.** `proc manpage` put the whole `--version` text into the `.TH` title, so its URL and licence lines left the title's quote open, and `man proc` showed `https://github.com/yazeed/proc-cli License: MIT"` under the title. This is the page `proc manpage` prints and the Nix package installs (found while packaging proc for Nix)
- **Windows: proc.exe no longer needs the Visual C++ runtime.** The Windows binary from Scoop, npm and GitHub Releases imported `VCRUNTIME140.dll` and the `api-ms-win-crt-*` libraries, so on a machine without the Visual C++ Redistributable it could not start. It now links the C runtime in (`.cargo/config.toml`, as ripgrep and fd do), and CI and the release build fail if `proc.exe` imports it again. GitHub's Windows runners have the runtime installed, which is why no test run showed it
- **A guard that rules out the target says so.** `proc stop 1234 --by node --yes` on a live process that isn't `node` gave `No process found matching '1234'`, word for word what a PID nobody holds gives, in human output and JSON alike. An agent following the skill's PID-guard rule read it as "the PID was recycled, the process is gone" when its own `--by` was mistyped, and moved on with the process still running (found by Jeff de Vries, an iLands agent, testing the skill). The error now names the guard: `No process found matching '1234' (ruled out by --by node)`, or `--in <dir>`, or both. It is still exit 2. This covers `kill`, `stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `wait`, `info` and `unstick` with targets; `on` and `tree` said `(no matches with specified filters)`, and now name the guard too (see Changed). `info` used to print its normal document with nothing in it (`found_count: 0`, `not_found: []`); it now prints this error

## 2.0.2 — 2026-10-30

**Changed**

- **A mistyped subcommand or value names the closest ones.** `proc kil` said only `unrecognized subcommand 'kil'`, and `--sort cp` only listed the allowed values: clap's own suggestion went out with its other tips. It now ends with `tip: did you mean 'kill'?` (in JSON, the `\n  Try: did you mean ...` line a mistyped flag already had), naming a subcommand by its name rather than an alias, closest first, three at most (`proc fre`: `'free' or 'freeze' or 'for'`). The human message also loses the blank lines the dropped tip left
- **The agent skill keeps a PID's start time and decides on numbers.** Rule 1: record a process's `start_time` with its PID, and check it is the same before acting on a PID recorded earlier, since the OS hands a dead process's PID to a new one. Rule 8: decide on the structured fields (`pid`, `parent_pid`, `start_time`, `uptime_secs`, ports, CPU and memory, exit code and `reason`); the text fields are only shown to the user. It also says that `on` answers in three shapes (`processes` for a port, `process` and `ports` for a PID, `results` for a name or several targets). Its frontmatter gains the optional `license`, `compatibility` and `metadata` fields of the Agent Skills spec, and its description and opening line use the words people search skills.sh with ("port in use", "kill a process", "free a port"), which found it before only by its name. Rule 1's example no longer has `$!` right before a backtick: skills.sh's scanner read that as a shell-command directive and labelled the skill "Contains Shell Commands" (Claude Code runs `` !`cmd` `` only after whitespace, so it never ran anything). The README's agent skill section shows the skills.sh install badge
- **Cargo.toml declares `rust-version = "1.88"`**, the version sysinfo 0.38 needs (checked with `cargo +1.88 check --all-targets`), so an older toolchain says so instead of failing inside a dependency. CI lints the tests and examples too (`cargo clippy --all-targets`), as CONTRIBUTING.md and RELEASE.md said it did. A release now starts with `rustup update stable`, the toolchain CI and the release builds use (a maintainer's 1.92 had been linting and testing for CI's 1.99), and checks the oldest supported Rust with `cargo +1.88 check --all-targets`. RELEASE.md says when `rust-version` is raised: only when a dependency or a feature we adopt needs it, to the lowest version that builds, never because a new stable came out
- **The README leads the way the website does**: one install line and the demo first, then what a command replaces, then the safety rules (it asks first, `--json` is not a yes, a name is the whole name), and the commands grouped by what they do. Six claims that were false or outdated for 2.0.1 are fixed: filters like `--min-cpu` do not combine with `kill` and the other changing commands, `ports --sort` takes port, pid or name, `list` and `watch` have no `not_found`, `free` stops with SIGTERM before SIGKILL, `wait` notices an exit within a quarter second, and the community `proc-bin` AUR package can lag behind releases

**Fixed**

- **A closed pipe no longer crashes proc (exit 101), and a `kill --yes` piped to a closed reader reports its real result.** `proc list | head -n1`, `proc list -j | head -c 100` and `proc on 99999999 2>&1 >/dev/null | true` ended in a panic (`failed printing to stdout`, exit 101), because Rust's `println!` panics when a write fails and a reader that stops early makes the write fail. Worst, `proc kill <pid> --yes | true` killed the process and then exited 101, so a caller could not tell whether anything was touched. Now a reader that stops early ends proc quietly: proc stops writing and exits with the code the command's own result calls for (a `kill` that worked is 0, a not-found is 2), says nothing about the pipe, and a closed pipe on stderr changes nothing. Any other write error (a full disk, a file size limit) is a failure: exit 1 and one line on stderr (`proc: cannot write to stdout: ...`), while a command that already failed keeps its own exit code. `--help`, `-h` and `--version` into a closed pipe exit 0 quietly, like `ls --help | head -n1`; they used to exit 0 even when nothing could be written, and now exit 1 then. `completions` and `manpage` no longer panic either. Every write to stdout or stderr goes through one module, `proc_cli::ui::out`, and `clippy.toml` bans `print!`, `println!`, `eprint!`, `eprintln!`, `dbg!` and `std::io::stdout`/`stderr` everywhere else, so a new direct print fails `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`. **Library API:** `proc_cli::ui::out` is new, with the macros `out_print!`, `out_println!`, `err_print!` and `err_println!`
- **A value with a line break no longer cuts the JSON error short.** `proc kill $':99999\nUsage: x' -j` gave `invalid value ':99999` and nothing after it, because the message was cut at any line that read `Usage:`. clap's own blocks start after a blank line, and only those are taken off now
- **A usage error in JSON now carries clap's whole message.** `proc kill --by wispworker -j` said `the following required arguments were not provided:` and stopped, because only the first line of clap's message was kept and clap puts the missing `<TARGET>...` on the next one. The same cut the `[possible values: ...]` off `--sort bogus` and `--status bogus`. The `error` now joins clap's meaningful lines with a space (`the following required arguments were not provided: <TARGET>...`, `invalid value 'bogus' for '--sort <SORT>' [possible values: cpu, mem, pid, name]`), without the `Usage:` block, the `--help` pointer and the `tip:` lines, and keeps the `\n  Try: did you mean '--json'?` suggestion. Human output is clap's usual rendering. A new test builds a corpus of parser errors from the command definitions (a missing required argument, an unknown flag, a bad value, a value the argument's own parser refuses such as a target `:99999` or `ports --range bogus`, a missing value and too many values, for every subcommand and argument; an argument whose parser is its own and has no bad value in the corpus fails the test) and checks each one, with and without `--json`, for exit 4, `reason: invalid_input`, a message that does not end at a colon and names the argument, value or allowed values at fault
- **A missing target next to `--by` or `--in` says what the filter does.** `proc kill --by wispworker` only listed `<TARGET>...` as missing, and an agent read `--by` as the way to pick processes. The error now adds `kill needs at least one target; --by filters the targets, it doesn't select them` (`--in` likewise; the command is named by its canonical name, so `proc k --in` says `kill`), in human and JSON output
- **An argument that is not UTF-8 is exit 4 invalid input, not a panic (exit 101).** `proc kill $'\xff'`, `proc list $'\xff'`, `proc in $'/tmp/\xff'` and `proc list --in $'\xff'` panicked because the three places that read the raw command line used `std::env::args()`. They read `args_os()` now, and an argument with a byte that is not UTF-8 gives `argument '\u{fffd}' is not valid UTF-8; proc takes its arguments as UTF-8`, with the bad bytes shown as U+FFFD, `reason: invalid_input` in JSON and the same text on stderr without it
- **The message for a missing `--yes` no longer starts with `Invalid input:`.** The call is valid and only needs a yes, and `reason: needs_confirmation` already says so. It now reads `stop changes processes, so it needs --yes, with --json too (or --dry-run to preview)`; the other invalid-input messages keep their prefix. **Library API:** the `Display` of `ProcError::ConfirmationRequired` is now just its message, without `Invalid input: `; `reason()` and the exit code are unchanged
- **A signal no longer leaves the terminal in raw mode.** `kill -TERM` on a `proc watch`, closing the pane it ran in, or `Ctrl+C` or SIGTERM at a `[y/N]` prompt left the shell with echo and line editing off, the alternate screen on and the cursor hidden, until `stty sane`. SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP and SIGQUIT (on Windows Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break and a closing console) now put the terminal back first, then end proc by that same signal, as a program without a handler would: a shell shows 130 for SIGINT and Ctrl+C, 143 for SIGTERM, 129 for SIGHUP, 131 for SIGQUIT, and Ctrl+C stops a script's loop (Windows has no signals, so there proc exits with 130). Nothing is printed, and a prompt that had not been answered changed nothing. The terminal is also restored when a write to it failed first. A program proc starts meanwhile (the `lsof` a `watch` refresh runs on macOS) starts with no signal blocked, so those signals still end it.
- **Windows: `proc for`, `proc on <name>` and `proc why --json` read the port table once.** They read it again for every process they showed, and each reading runs `netstat` twice and `tasklist` for every listening socket, so `proc for` on a program with a few copies running took over a minute in CI. A reading also names its sockets from one process list instead of a `tasklist` for each, which had `proc ports --in` past a minute on a busy machine
- **The npm launcher ends the way proc did.** A proc that a signal ended made `npx proc-cli` exit 1; it now ends by the same signal, so a shell sees 130 or 143 as it would without npm.
- **A prompt always shows what you would approve.** The list of processes went to stdout and the `[y/N]` question to stderr, so with stdout in a file or a pipe whose reader had left (`proc kill node | head -n1`, `proc kill node > log`) you were asked about processes you could not see, and a `y` was a blind yes. `kill`, `stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `free`, `unstick`, `stuck --kill` and `orphans --kill` now ask through one function: the list goes to stdout when that is a terminal and to stderr, beside the question, when it is not. If the list cannot be written, nothing is asked and nothing is changed: exit 4, `needs_confirmation`. `clippy.toml` bans dialoguer's `interact` methods outside that function.
- **`proc watch --json` stops at once when its reader leaves.** `proc watch node -j -n 20 | head -n1` kept running until the next refresh (6 s later in the test, an hour with `-n 3600`) because a closed pipe is only noticed by a write. On Linux and macOS the wait between refreshes now watches the pipe and ends the moment the reader closes it; Windows notices at the next refresh. `proc wait` is the other way on purpose and is now written down: its exit code (0 exited, 1 timed out) is its result, so it keeps waiting after its reader leaves and exits with that code.
- **`proc watch` without a terminal on stdin shows one snapshot instead of failing.** `proc watch node < /dev/null` on a terminal drew a frame, then stopped with `System error: Failed to initialize input reader` (exit 1). The screen needs a key to quit with, so without a terminal on both ends watch prints one snapshot like `list`, and says so on stderr when stdout is a terminal.
- **A failed write to the watch screen follows the same rules as every other write.** It ended in `Broken pipe (os error 32)` and exit 1, and the escape codes that put the terminal back were refused once any earlier write had failed. A reader that left now ends watch quietly, any other failure is the usual `cannot write to stdout` and exit 1, and the terminal is put back either way.
- **Failures that used to look like answers now say what went wrong.** A script that relied on the old results will see an error where it saw success:
  - `proc tree -a` (`--ancestors`) with no target printed nothing and exited 0; it is exit 4 (`invalid_input`): `--ancestors needs a target`
  - `proc tree <name>` for a name that matches no process printed an empty tree and exited 0; it is exit 2, like `info` and a PID that doesn't exist
  - `proc tree <pid> --by <name>` or `--in <dir>` that rules the target out printed an empty tree and exited 0; it is exit 2 (`no matches with specified filters`), the PID guard `info` and `on` already gave. `tree -a` ignored `--in` and `--by` altogether, and now keeps to them the same way
  - An empty target (`proc watch ""`, `proc kill ","`) watched or matched every process; it is exit 4: `a target can't be empty`. Any other empty argument is exit 4 too: `in ""`, `for ""` and `--in ""` (an unset `"$DIR"`) meant the current directory, `list ""` listed nothing and `by ""` was not found. `--in=` names its flag: `--in can't be empty`
  - `--in <dir>` for a directory that does not exist, with nothing running there, was accepted by most commands as a filter that matches nothing (or, on `watch`, as an empty view); it is exit 4 (`Directory not found`) on every command with `--in`, as `proc in` already did, and `Not a directory` for a file. A deleted directory that processes still run in is kept, so its leftovers can be found, also when it is typed through a symlink (`/tmp/x`, which macOS reports as `/private/tmp/x`) and, for `ports`, when the process there listens on nothing. `on` said its targets were not in the directory (exit 2), exactly what it says for a directory that exists, so a typo looked like an answer; it is exit 4 too. **Library API:** `OnCommand` and `WatchCommand` keep the resolved `--in` in a private field (it was turned back into text and resolved again for every process, and an error there dropped the filter), so outside the crate they are built by parsing arguments (`Cli::try_parse_from`), not with a struct literal
  - A relative path when the current directory has been deleted said `No process found matching 'unknown'` (`proc for ./x`); it is exit 4 and says the current directory no longer exists
- **`--in` compares the real directory, not the text shown for it.** A directory name with a control character is shown escaped (a newline as `\n`), and `--in` compared that text, so such a directory could not be matched, and one named `a\nb` (a backslash and an `n`) matched both. `on`, `for`, `list`, `by`, `watch`, `ports` and the commands that change processes now all match the real path through one function
- **`proc tree --in <dir>` with no target shows the processes in that directory**, each with its subtree, as `--min-cpu` does. It ignored `--in` and `--by` without a target and printed every process. A match inside another match's tree (a shell and the server it started share a directory) is shown there once, not again as a root of its own; `--min-cpu` and the other filters showed it twice too

## 2.0.1 — 2026-10-28

**Added**

- **Every exit-4 JSON error says why, in `reason`.** Exit 4 means nothing was done, for one of three causes, and only a missing `--yes` was machine-readable (`needs_confirmation: true`). A wrong flag such as `proc kill --name wispworker -j` came back as exit 4 with only the text `unexpected argument '--name' found`, so an agent had to read prose to know it should fix the command. The error now has `"reason"`: `"invalid_input"` for a wrong flag, value or argument (clap's own usage errors included), `"needs_confirmation"` for a missing `--yes` (which keeps `needs_confirmation: true` for agents written against 2.0.0), and `"not_supported"` for `freeze`, `thaw`, `orphans` and `stop --signal` on Windows. Exits 1 to 3 have no `reason`. Human output is unchanged. The skill's exit-code table and `reference.md` say to branch on `reason`. **Library API:** `ProcError::reason()` returns it (`None` unless the error is exit 4), and `proc_cli::error` has the strings as `REASON_INVALID_INPUT`, `REASON_NEEDS_CONFIRMATION` and `REASON_NOT_SUPPORTED`

**Changed**

- **`proc --help` ends with short labelled sections instead of one dense paragraph, and its examples are styled the same way** (an `Examples:` header, commands highlighted, meanings aligned). `Targets:` (`:3000`, `1234`, `node`, several as separate arguments), `Names:` (what a name matches, `--cmd`, a path is not a name, wildcards), `Notes:` (the deprecated comma list, `--in`) and a `More:` link, with the meanings aligned like the `Options:` list. Headers and literals use the help's own styles (`proc_cli::cli::STYLES`, clap's default look), so they follow clap's colour handling: no colour codes when piped or with `NO_COLOR`, and none in `proc manpage` or the completions. `proc -h` gets the `Targets:` section and the link. The facts are the same. **Library API:** `proc_cli::cli::STYLES` is new
- **The agent skill treats process fields as data, not instructions** (rule 8). A process's name, command line, working directory, executable path and user are written by whoever started it, so an agent never acts on text found in them and tells the user if one reads like an instruction
- **The skill and its JSON reference say how to tell exit-4 cases apart:** only the confirmation error has a `needs_confirmation` key (always `true`), and a successful action's `succeeded` and `failed` lists are the receipt for the preview's `processes`
- **The README points Arch Linux users to `proc-bin`**, the community AUR package of the release binaries, until proc's own AUR package is published
- **`--sort` help says which way each key runs** on `list`, `by`, `in`, `for`, `watch` and `ports`: cpu and mem put the biggest first; pid, name and port go ascending. Ties come by PID (by port, then PID, for `ports`)

**Fixed**

- **Windows: `stop --signal` is a "not supported" error**, as the docs already said: `reason` is `not_supported` and the message starts "Not supported on this platform". It was reported as invalid input
- **The order of what proc prints is the same on every run, and `--limit` picks the same rows.** `proc by zsh --json` listed its PIDs in a new order each time, and `proc list --limit 8` returned different processes each time. The process list came out of a randomly ordered map, and `--sort cpu` (the default) ties for nearly every process, so the ties kept the random order. Now every process source lists by PID ascending and a sort breaks ties by PID, so a name, `--limit`, `orphans`, `stuck` and every list a command asks you to approve read the same twice
- **`tree` and `tree --json` give the same tree.** The human tree sorted each parent's children by PID, but the JSON children, the roots, the filtered list, the target list and `--ancestors` for a name came out in a new order every run. All of them are now in PID order, in both forms
- **A process's ports are ascending** in `on <pid>`, `for` and `why`, and `ports --sort pid` and `--sort name` break ties by port, then PID. They followed the order lsof (macOS), the kernel's socket table (Linux) or netstat (Windows) listed them in. The holders of a port are by PID, and `on :port --json` has `process`, `protocol` and `address` of the holder with the lowest PID on every OS (Linux and Windows used to follow the kernel's or netstat's listing order; macOS already did)
- **The list a command asks you to approve is in a stated order**: the targets in the order typed, then PID ascending within each target. `kill`, `stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `free`, `unstick`, `orphans --kill` and `stuck --kill` use it for the preview, the prompt, `--dry-run --json`, the `needs_confirmation` list and the receipt. `stop` reports `failed` in that order too, instead of the processes that refused the signal followed by the ones it could not force-kill

<!-- End of the part from CHANGELOG.md -->

## 2.0.0 — 2026-10-28

This is a major release. Read **Changed** first: a name now matches the whole process name (add `--cmd` for the old matching), and `--json` no longer counts as `--yes`. The library API changed too (see the entries marked **Library API**).

**Changed**

- **BREAKING: a name matches the whole process name, not any part of the name or command line.** `proc kill node` used to kill every process whose name or full command line contained `node`, ignoring case. On one Mac a dry run matched 193 processes, among them `Claude Helper` and `Obsidian Helper (Renderer)`; with `--yes` all of them would have been killed. A name now equals the process name, the file name of its executable, or the file name of its first argument, ignoring case, as `killall` and `pkill` read it. The executable and first argument count because Linux cuts a process name to 15 characters. On Windows a trailing `.exe` is optional on either side. The same rule applies to every name target and every `--by` filter. A path is not a name: use `--cmd`, or `proc for <file>` for an executable. An empty name used to match every process and now matches nothing.
  **Migration:** add `--cmd` to keep the old matching (`proc kill node --cmd`), or name the process exactly. A script that passed a part of a name now gets exit 2 (`No process found matching`) where it matched before; one that relied on a command-line match needs `--cmd`
- **`--json` no longer counts as a yes.** Commands that change processes (`kill`, `stop`, `free`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `unstick`, `orphans --kill`, `stuck --kill`) acted without asking when given `--json`. They now need `--yes` like everywhere else: without it they exit 4 and change nothing, and so does running without a terminal. `--dry-run` still previews without `--yes`. With `--json` the error carries `needs_confirmation: true` and the `processes` the command would have changed, so a caller can show the list before retrying with `--yes`
- **On macOS the JSON `address` of an IPv6 listener loses its brackets**: `[::1]` is now `::1`, matching Linux and Windows
- **Action JSON lists the targets that weren't found.** Every command that takes targets puts `not_found` in its JSON, an array that is empty when every target was found. The found processes are still handled, so `success` and the exit codes are unchanged. `proc free` on a port nobody holds is success (exit 0) with the port in `not_found`
- **"Not supported on this OS" is exit 4.** `freeze` and `thaw` on Windows exited 1, while `stop --signal` exited 4. All three now exit 4
- **`orphans` is not supported on Windows: it exits 4.** It always reported "No orphaned processes found" there, because Windows has no PID 1 and does not re-parent a process whose parent exited. It now exits 4, like `freeze` and `thaw`. Linux and macOS are unchanged
- **`--version` says when a build isn't a release.** A build from `main` printed the version of the last release. A build from the release tag prints the plain version (`proc 2.0.0`); any other build in a git checkout prints `proc 2.0.0-dev (main@5e94647, 3 commits after v2.0.0)`. Builds without git (crates.io, a Docker context without `.git`) print the plain version
- **Library API.** Name matching takes a `proc_cli::core::NameMatch` (`Exact` or `Command`) as a last argument in `Process::find_by_name`, `resolve_target`, `resolve_targets`, `resolve_targets_excluding_self`, `matches_by_filter` and `apply_filters`; `resolve_targets` returns a `Resolved { processes, not_found, hints }`. `Process` has two new fields, `argv0` and `raw`. `ProcError` has new variants `NameNotFound`, `FilteredOut` and `ConfirmationRequired`; it is not `#[non_exhaustive]`, so an exhaustive `match` must handle them. `ProcError::NotSupported` exits 4. `Process::find_orphans` returns `NotSupported` on Windows (it returned an empty list). `PortInfo::find_by_port` is now `PortInfo::holders_of` and returns every holder. New `proc_cli::ui::must_confirm`; `Printer::ask_confirm` no longer treats `--json` as a yes. The command structs changed their fields (`target` is a `Vec<String>`, `ports`' `range` is parsed, new `cmd` and `wide`), and `Process::kill_and_wait` returns `Result<()>`. `proc_cli::cli` and `proc_cli::version` are new modules. See the [full changelog](https://github.com/yazeed/proc-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the list
- **Help and docs examples never pair `--yes` with a name.** `--yes` appears only with a `:port` or a PID; a name is shown with `--dry-run`, or without `--yes` so it asks first. A test reads the docs and fails on a name next to `--yes`. proc has no wildcards: an unquoted `node*` is expanded by your shell, and `--cmd` is the way to a partial match
- **CI fails when a line or a flag has no test.** The coverage gate now fails the build below 100% line coverage of `src/`, merged across Linux, macOS and Windows, and when a long or short flag of a process command has no test. The gate's report also prints each OS's own total, for information only: the merged 100% stays the only rule
- **Every CI job has a time limit**, so a hung test fails the job instead of holding a runner for up to six hours
- **The agent skill is rewritten for 2.0.0** around a safety model: what only reads, what can be undone and what ends a process; ranked rules (a process is yours only if you started it, a name is a search and never approval, preview with `--dry-run --json` and show the user, `--yes` is the user's consent to one list); and what to do on exit 4. It asks before touching what it didn't start. New `evals.md` lists twelve tasks with what the agent must and must never do
- **A bare `proc` orients you** instead of listing all 19 commands: the idea that a target is the same everywhere, and four commands that run exactly as printed
- **One process is always one line.** The process table truncates to the terminal width instead of wrapping, long directories keep their root and their tail, and `proc watch` uses the same layout
- **Website redesign ([proc-cli.com](https://proc-cli.com)).** A new layout and type, light and dark themes, an interactive command reader on the home page, a sidebar of commands, and a changelog sidebar of versions. Page titles, headings and tables use sentence case
- **`proc wait` notices an exit within a quarter second**, instead of checking only every `--interval`. `--interval` now sets how often the status line is printed
- **`proc stop` asks every process at once and waits for them together**, so several processes share one `--timeout`
- **`proc ports` and `proc on :port` show full process names on macOS** (lsof cut them to 9 characters)
- **`proc stuck` needs a process to stay stuck.** It must have run longer than `--timeout` and, in two readings a second apart, use over 50% CPU or be blocked in uninterruptible sleep. `stuck` now takes about 2 seconds
- **Port lookups on Linux need nothing installed.** proc reads the kernel's socket tables in `/proc` instead of running `ss`, so they work on minimal systems without iproute2, and the Docker image no longer installs it

**Added**

- **Several targets can be separate arguments.** `proc kill 1234 5678 :8080` works everywhere proc took a comma-separated list: `kill`, `stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `free`, `on`, `why`, `wait`, `unstick`, `watch` and the names of `list`. Separate arguments and comma lists mix, and a process named twice is handled once. `--in` takes the next word as its directory unless it starts with `-`, so put it after the targets or write `--in=DIR`
- **`--cmd` matches names the old way.** `proc kill serve --cmd` matches any process with `serve` in its name or full command line, like `pkill -f`. It is on every command that takes a name target or `--by`, and has no short form. When a name matches nothing but some command lines have it, the not-found message says so
- **`--wide` / `-w` on `list`, `by`, `in`, `for`, `stuck`, `orphans` and `watch`**: prints directories and arguments in full instead of fitting them to the terminal
- **[FAQ page](https://proc-cli.com/faq)**: 16 answers to the most searched process and port questions, each with the proc command and the classic alternative
- **Blog post**: [What's new in proc](https://proc-cli.com/posts/whats-new-in-proc)
- **Structured data and a favicon** on the website: SoftwareApplication, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, post authors, social card images, and `favicon.ico`, `favicon.svg` and an `apple-touch-icon.png`

**Deprecated**

- **Comma-separated targets** (`proc kill :3000,:8080`). They still work throughout 2.x, and a command that uses one now prints a single `note:` on stderr naming the fix, built from your own targets: `note: comma-separated targets are deprecated and will be removed in a future major release; pass them as separate arguments: proc kill :3000 :8080`. It appears in human output only, so `--json` output is unchanged on stdout and stderr, and it is coloured on a terminal unless `NO_COLOR` is set. Separate arguments are the recommended form and commas will be removed in a future major release

**Removed**

- **Printing helpers and library functions nothing called**: `Printer::error`, `Printer::print_ports`, `Printer::print_port_info`, `Printer::print_kill_result`, `resolve_target_single` and `Process::wait`
- **Unused dependencies `tokio`, `anyhow` and `indicatif`**; builds are smaller and faster

**Fixed**

- **`proc free` called a port free when a copy of the holder took it back a moment later.** A port now counts as free only when it reads free in two looks a quarter of a second apart
- **A port held by several processes was handled as if one held it** (for example `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]`, or a master and its forked workers). A `:port` now means every process listening on it, in `kill`, `stop`, `free`, `on`, `info`, `wait`, `tree`, `watch` and `why`. `on :3000 --json` keeps `process` as the first holder and adds `processes`
- **Windows never listed IPv6 listeners, and macOS reported them differently.** All three systems now report `::1` and `::` (thanks @gtwatts, #1)
- **`proc kill --graceful` reported success on Windows when nothing happened**, and **`proc unstick --force` on Windows reported an already-gone process as failed**
- **`proc stuck` never found a stuck process on Windows**, and targeted `unstick` never saw one as stuck. CPU is now measured the way `list` and `info` do on every OS
- **`proc tree <name>` and `proc watch <name>` listed the shell that launched them.** Name matching now skips proc's ancestors in every command
- **`--in` found nothing when the path was a symlink or not in the OS's own form** (`/tmp` on macOS, 8.3 short names on Windows)
- **`proc stuck --timeout N` needed a process to be N+1 seconds old**, and **`proc for <file>` found nothing on Windows**
- **Not-found messages no longer nest a sentence inside a sentence or put the filter note inside the quotes**: `No process found matching 'node' (no matches with specified filters)`
- **proc could crash on a non-ASCII path, process name or argument.** Truncation now counts display columns and never splits a character
- **`proc stop`, `orphans --kill` and `stuck --kill` could hang forever** on a zombie whose parent didn't reap it; waiting after SIGKILL is limited to 5 seconds
- **Zombies counted as running on Linux and were never listed on macOS**
- **A reused PID counted as the original process**: `wait`, `stop` and the others now compare the start time too
- **`wait --timeout`, `free --wait` and `watch --interval` edge cases**: `--timeout 1` took 5 seconds, `--wait` wasn't a maximum, and `nan`, `inf`, a negative number or `0` crashed or busy-looped `watch`; they now exit 4 or are bounded
- **`proc ports --range` ignored a range it couldn't read**, and **a mistyped port such as `:70000` was searched for as a name**; both now exit 4
- **IPv6 addresses on Linux came out as `]`**, so `ports --exposed` left out ports listening on `::`
- **`proc unstick <target>` never tried**, and **CPU readings were wrong** (a process using a whole core showed as about 0.4%). `list`, `by`, `in`, `for`, `info`, `on`, `tree`, `orphans` and `wait -v` now measure CPU over 0.2 s before they show, filter or sort by it
- **Name matching read escaped text in some places and the raw text in others**, so `--by` could drop a process `find_by_name` found

**Security**

- **Signals can't reach a process that reused the PID.** Every signal first checks that the PID still belongs to the same process, by its start time
- **Process names from lsof can't inject terminal escapes or crash proc (macOS)**
- **Process data can't control the terminal.** Names, command lines, working directories, executable paths and users could carry escape sequences that recolour, retitle or rewrite the terminal of whoever ran `proc list`, `info`, `ports` or `watch`. Control characters are now shown as visible escapes, in every view and in JSON

## 1.14.5 — 2026-10-25

**Changed**

- **Uptime in every process view.** It was missing from several:
  - `proc on <PID|name>` shows an `Uptime:` line, like `proc on :port`
  - `proc tree` (including `--ancestors`) and `proc why` show `up 3m 12s` on each line, so a long-lived parent such as a forgotten tmux session stands out
  - `proc watch` has the UPTIME column on terminals at least 100 columns wide, and an `uptime:` line with `--verbose`
  - in JSON, `uptime_secs` is now on `tree` and `tree --ancestors` nodes, on `why`'s process and ancestry entries, and on `unstick`'s results; every other command already had it

  The JSON changes only add fields
- **`proc for` uses the standard layouts.** One process gets the same detail view as `proc on :port` (directory, path, listening ports, resources, uptime). Several get the standard process table (directory, arguments, uptime, status) followed by the ports they listen on, instead of a table of their own
- **`proc on :port`** reads uptime from `uptime_secs`, like every other command, instead of working it out from `start_time`
- **npm package: no install script.** The binary is now downloaded the first time you run `proc`, which is already what happened on npm 12 and newer (they skip install scripts). Its checksum is verified either way. `node install.js` in the package directory still downloads it ahead of time, for example in an image that will run offline. This removes the "install scripts" supply-chain alert that scanners such as Socket raise
- **Socket badge** in the README
- **Website: an [agent skill](https://proc-cli.com/skill) page.** It covers installing the skill (`npx skills add`, `bunx`, the Claude Code plugin), updating it, what it teaches agents, and prompts to try. It's linked from the navigation, the install page and the README
- **Demo recording** re-rendered, so `proc why` shows the uptime of each process in the chain

**Fixed**

- **Uptime of about 56 years for other users' processes on macOS.** proc can't read their start time, and the system reports it as 0, so `start_time` was `0`, `uptime_secs` was roughly the time since 1970, and `--min-uptime` always matched them. On one Mac that was 233 of 1,516 processes, including `launchd`. Their start time and uptime are now reported as unknown: left out of JSON, `-` in tables, and never matched by `--min-uptime`
- **`--status` with an unknown value matched every process**, so a typo such as `--status stoped` listed everything. It now exits 4 and lists the valid values (`running`, `sleeping`, `stopped`, `zombie`); `stop`, `sleep` and any letter case still work. The same filter is shared by `list`, `by`, `in`, `for` and `tree`, which each had their own copy
- **Windows: `proc stop --signal` ignored the signal** and sent an ordinary stop. Windows has no signals, so `--signal` now exits 4 there with an explanation

## 1.14.4 — 2026-10-25

**Fixed**
- **Linux: threads were listed as processes.** `list`, `by`, `in`, `orphans`, `stuck`, `watch` and name targets listed every thread of a process as a separate entry, with the process's command line. A Node dev server, for example, showed up a dozen times, and a name target such as `proc kill node` resolved those extra entries too. Only processes are listed now. macOS and Windows were not affected
- **`proc orphans` and `proc stuck`** printed two headlines for one result ("⚠ Found 2 orphaned processes", then "✓ Found 2 processes"). They now print one

**Changed**
- **New demo recording** (README GIF and website video). It tells one story:
  - `npm run dev` fails because port 3000 is taken
  - `proc on`, `proc why` and `proc free` find the old tmux session holding the port and free it
  - `proc orphans` finds the leftovers, shows them as JSON, and cleans them up after a confirmation

  It's recorded in a staged project (`demo/`), so the recording tool's own processes no longer appear, and it's larger and easier to read. To regenerate it, run the two commands at the top of `demo.Dockerfile`
- **`.dockerignore`** keeps `target/` and other unused folders out of Docker build contexts

## 1.14.3 — 2026-10-25

**Changed**
- **Repository renamed to [`yazeed/proc-cli`](https://github.com/yazeed/proc-cli)**, matching the crate, the npm package, the agent skill and proc-cli.com. Old `github.com/yazeed/proc` links, git remotes and release downloads redirect, so existing installs keep working. Install commands now use the new name: `npx skills add yazeed/proc-cli`, `/plugin marketplace add yazeed/proc-cli`, `nix profile install github:yazeed/proc-cli`. The Homebrew command is unchanged (`brew install yazeed/proc/proc`)
- **Docker image published as `yazeed/proc-cli`.** Docker Hub can't rename repositories, so each release also pushes the same image to `yazeed/proc`, and `docker pull yazeed/proc` keeps getting updates

**Removed**
- **`Formula/proc.rb` and `pkg/scoop/proc.json`**: hand-maintained copies left over from before publishing was automated (frozen at 1.2.2 and 1.3.3 since January). Releases have written the real Homebrew formula and Scoop manifest to `yazeed/homebrew-proc` and `yazeed/scoop-bucket-proc` ever since; nothing read these

## 1.14.2 — 2026-10-25

**Fixed**
- **`proc stop --signal`** only checked the signal name after the dry run and the confirmation prompt. `--dry-run` reported success for a signal the real run rejects (`--signal 9`), and without `--yes` you confirmed before being told the name was invalid. An unknown signal now exits 4 straight away, with or without `--dry-run`

**Changed**
- **Website** moved to [proc-cli.com](https://proc-cli.com). The old `yazeed.github.io/proc` address redirects there
- **PHILOSOPHY.md** describes proc as it is today: every command in the grammar, the JSON and exit-code contract shared by people, scripts and agents, how targets are read without guessing, and `--kill` on `orphans`/`stuck`

## 1.14.1 — 2026-10-25

**Fixed**
- **`proc in <dir>`** exited 4 ("Directory not found") when the directory had been deleted, even with processes still running in it, such as a dev server left behind in a removed git worktree. It now lists them. A missing path with nothing running in it still exits 4, as a typo
- **Linux: processes in a deleted directory** reported their `cwd` as `<dir> (deleted)`, which the kernel appends, so `--in <dir>` never matched them. `cwd` now shows the plain path, as on macOS, and `--in` matches it

**Changed**
- **Skill**: tells agents when to reach for proc. It covers:
  - a fuller description of situations that trigger the skill (a busy port, `EADDRINUSE`, leftover dev servers and headless browsers, a slow machine)
  - a table of the shell commands proc replaces (`lsof`, `ps | grep`, `pkill`, `kill`)
  - playbooks for a busy port, cleaning up background work, checking for leftovers before finishing, a slow machine, and clean restarts
  - safety rules for not touching other people's or other agents' processes
  - how to check the installed version and install proc
  - the command aliases, and the flags it was missing (`list --path`, `ports --local`, `tree --depth`/`--compact`, `orphans --kill`)
  - new gotchas: `kill`/`stop` don't signal children, how to find processes left running in a deleted directory, and an orphan isn't necessarily abandoned
- **Release checklist**: triggers a skills.sh refresh after publishing, since skills.sh only re-reads the repo when someone installs the skill

## 1.14.0 — 2026-10-25

**Added**
- **Uptime in process output**: every process in JSON has `uptime_secs`; tables from `list`, `by`, `in` and the other process lists show an `UPTIME` column on terminals at least 100 columns wide, and `--verbose` prints it
- **`proc inspect`**: alias of `proc info`, next to `i`
- **Skill**: explains that inspecting a process means `proc info` (or `proc inspect`) and what it reports, that `by` takes one pattern while `list` takes comma-separated ones, and that `start_time` is a timestamp while `uptime_secs` is the duration

**Changed**
- **Release checklist**: after publishing, upgrades the local Homebrew `proc` on its own (`brew upgrade yazeed/proc/proc`) and checks its version

## 1.13.4 — 2026-10-25

**Fixed**
- **Linux binaries** failed to start on anything older than Ubuntu 24.04 (`GLIBC_2.39 not found`, e.g. on Debian 12), because they were built on the `ubuntu-latest` runner and linked against its glibc. They are now static musl builds (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`) with no glibc dependency. Tested on x86_64 and ARM64 with Amazon Linux 2, Debian 10, 11 and 12, Ubuntu 20.04 and Alpine 3.20. File names are unchanged, so the curl install, npm, Homebrew on Linux and cargo-binstall pick them up as before
- **Docker image**: `on :port`, `ports` and `free` failed with `Failed to run ss: No such file or directory`, because the image didn't include `ss`, which port lookups use on Linux. The image now installs `iproute2`. The documented `docker run` command adds `--net=host`, which port lookups need to see the host's ports
- **`user`** showed the numeric user ID (e.g. `"501"`) in JSON, `info`, `list` and `watch`. It now shows the user name, and falls back to the ID when the ID has no name on the system. Scripts that read `user` as a number need updating

**Changed**
- **CI** builds the same Linux targets as a release, including ARM64, so a broken release build shows up on every push instead of at tag time
- **cargo-binstall**: musl hosts (Alpine) now resolve to the Linux release files
- **Release checklist**: runs the published Linux binaries on Debian 11 and Alpine

## 1.13.3 — 2026-10-24

**Fixed**
- **`npm install proc-cli`** failed for every version with `Redirect to untrusted host: release-assets.githubusercontent.com`. GitHub now serves release downloads from that host, which the installer's allowlist didn't include. It is now allowed; the existing hosts and the SHA-256 checksum check are unchanged
- **npm 12**: install scripts no longer run by default, so the binary was never downloaded and `proc` crashed. The `proc` command now downloads and verifies the binary on first run when it is missing, with progress on stderr so `--json` output stays clean. If the package directory isn't writable, the binary goes to `~/.cache/proc-cli/<version>` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\proc-cli\<version>` on Windows). A failed download during install no longer fails `npm install`; it is retried on first run
- **npm wrapper**: a `proc` killed by a signal now exits non-zero, and a binary that can't be started reports an error instead of crashing

**Changed**
- **Release checklist**: installs the npm package from a local tarball before tagging, and runs a real `npm install` after publishing

## 1.13.2 — 2026-10-24

**Changed**
- **npm publishing** uses Trusted Publishing (OIDC) from the release workflow instead of a stored token. The `NPM_TOKEN` secret is no longer used. The publish job runs on Node 24 with npm 11.5.1 or newer, as Trusted Publishing requires. 1.13.0 and 1.13.1 were not published to npm, so npm goes from 1.12.3 to 1.13.2

## 1.13.1 — 2026-10-24

**Fixed**
- **Docker image**: the binary failed to start (`GLIBC_2.39 not found`) on both amd64 and arm64, since at least 1.12.3. The build stage used `rust:latest`, which moved to Debian trixie, while the runtime stage is `debian:bookworm-slim` (glibc 2.36). The build stage now uses `rust:1-bookworm`
- **Release workflow**: the crates.io and npm publish steps reported success even when publishing failed, because the result was piped through `tee` without `pipefail`. This hid that 1.13.0 was never published to npm

## 1.13.0 — 2026-10-24

A consistent JSON and exit-code contract: every command prints one JSON document, `action` is always the command name, and `"success": false` always comes with a non-zero exit code. Scripts that relied on the old behaviour should check the **Changed** entries below.

**Changed**
- **`--dry-run --json`** now reports the command's own `action` (e.g. `"kill"`) and `"dry_run": true`, instead of a list result with `"action": "list"` (`kill`, `stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `free`, `orphans --kill`, `stuck --kill`)
- **`proc orphans --kill` / `proc stuck --kill` with `--json`** print one action result (`"action": "orphans"`/`"stuck"`, `succeeded`/`failed`) instead of two JSON documents
- **`proc thaw --json`** reports `"action": "thaw"` instead of `"resume"`
- **`proc why` / `proc tree` JSON** use lowercase `status` (`"running"`) and `protocol` (`"tcp"`), matching the Process and Port objects
- **Invalid flags and arguments** exit with code 4 (invalid input) instead of 2, which meant "not found"; with `--json` the error is a JSON object on stdout
- **`proc wait --json` on timeout** exits 1, as it already did without `--json`
- **`proc stop`, `freeze`, `thaw`, `orphans --kill`, `stuck --kill`** exit 1 when any process fails, as `proc kill` already did
- **`proc free`** exits 1 when a port is still in use after `--wait`
- **`proc unstick`** exits 1 when a process is still stuck or failed; an explicit target removed by `--in`/`--by` is "not found" (exit 2)
- **`proc info`** exits 2 when no target is found
- **`proc on` with multiple targets and `--json`** prints one document (`count`, `results` with `target`/`process`/`ports`, `not_found`) instead of one per target; exits 2 when no target is found
- **`proc in <path>`** exits 4 when the directory does not exist, like `proc for` with a missing file

**Fixed**
- **`proc why --json`** prints a JSON error and exits 2 when nothing is found, instead of printing nothing and exiting 0; multiple targets print one document instead of one per target
- **`proc kill --json`** no longer prints a second JSON error document after a partial failure
- **Error `action`** uses the canonical command name when an alias is used (`proc k` → `"kill"`)
- **JSON errors** are detected for short-flag clusters such as `-yj`
- **Human output**: "Stopped" instead of "Stoped"
- **Agent skill**: `SKILL.md` covers `proc for`, `proc in`, `proc unstick`, `--ancestors`, `--graceful`, `--exposed`/`--local`/`--range`, `--status`, `--min-uptime`, `--parent`, with a per-command filter table and the bounded `proc watch --json` stream; `reference.md` adds the `on <PID>`, `tree --ancestors`, `--dry-run`, `unstick`, and `watch` shapes
- **Plugin manifest**: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` version kept in sync and added to the release checklist

**Added**
- **Docs**: agent skill install instructions (`npx skills add yazeed/proc`, Claude Code plugin) in README and the install page; exit code table in README and the commands page
- **Tests**: JSON contract integration tests (`tests/cli_json.rs`)

## 1.12.3 — 2026-05-03

**Fixed**
- **Clippy**: Use `sort_by_key` instead of `sort_by` for name sorting (Rust 1.95+ lint)

## 1.12.2 — 2026-03-30

**Security**
- **npm install script hardened**: SHA-256 checksum verification, redirect host pinning, `execFileSync` (no shell injection), dead code removed

**Fixed**
- **README**: SafeSkill badge, correct badge ordering
- **Skills**: Added `proc for` and empty result JSON schemas to reference
- **Rust docs**: Added `wait`, `free`, `why`, `freeze/thaw`, `--signal`, `--json` to Quick Start and Features

## 1.12.1 — 2026-03-27

**Fixed**
- **CI**: Upgrade to `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` — v1 fails with immutable releases enabled

## 1.12.0 — 2026-03-27

**Added**
- **`proc wait`**: Block until process(es) exit — the pipe-friendly replacement for `while ps aux | grep ... | grep -v grep; do sleep; done`
  - `proc wait node` — wait until all node processes exit
  - `proc wait :3000 --timeout 60` — wait up to 60s for port process to exit
  - `proc wait node -n 10 -q` — check every 10s, quiet mode for scripting
  - Supports `--in`, `--by`, `--json`, `--verbose` like other commands
  - Reports each process as it exits, with elapsed time
  - JSON output includes per-process exit timing and timeout status

**Fixed**
- **`--by` now matches full command line**: The `--by` filter across all commands now matches against both process name AND command line arguments (consistent with how positional targets and `proc by` work). Previously `proc wait node --by KXBTCD` would not match a process whose args contained "KXBTCD" — now it does. Affects: kill, stop, freeze, thaw, info, tree, stuck, unstick, orphans, wait, on, watch, for
- **JSON output for empty results**: Commands that find nothing (`stuck`, `orphans`, `free` when ports already free) now output `{"action":"...", "success":true, "count":0, "message":"..."}` in JSON mode instead of empty stdout
- **Consistent JSON envelopes**: `on` (name target), `for`, `why` now wrap results in `{"action":"...", "success":true, "count":N, "results":[...]}` instead of outputting bare arrays
- **Consistent JSON action field**: All commands now use lowercase action names (`"kill"`, `"stop"`, `"freeze"`, `"resume"`) instead of mixed-case past-tense verbs (`"Killed"`, `"Stopped"`)
- **Command-specific action names**: `by`, `in`, `stuck`, `orphans` now report their own command name as the JSON `action` field instead of generic `"list"`
- **`wait` timeout no longer double-outputs JSON**: Previously emitted both a WaitOutput and an error envelope; now emits a single `{"success":false, "timed_out":true, ...}` object
- **Error envelope includes `action` field**: JSON error responses now include the command name (e.g. `{"action":"kill", "success":false, "error":"...", "exit_code":2}`)
- **`watch` JSON includes `success` field**: Consistent with all other commands
- **`tree --ancestors` uses `action: "tree"`**: Consistent regardless of `--ancestors` flag
- **Ancestor chain exclusion**: Name matching now excludes the entire ancestor process chain (up to 10 levels) instead of just the immediate parent. Prevents false matches in deep shell environments (IDE → terminal → shell → shell wrapper → proc)

**Changed**
- **Shared `matches_by_filter`**: Extracted the `--by` matching logic into `core::filters::matches_by_filter()`, replacing 14 inline copies with a single consistent implementation
- **Agent Skills**: Added `proc wait` to skill reference, added "Agent/Pipe Readiness" section documenting which commands are safe for agents vs interactive-only
- **`src/lib.rs`**: Clarified `watch` as interactive TUI, `wait` as pipe-friendly blocking

**Updated**
- Updated dependencies (`mio`, `roff`, `unicode-segmentation`, `wasm-bindgen`)

## 1.11.0 — 2026-03-23

**Changed**
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added explicit rules requiring user approval before every push, tag, and release. Added mandatory RELEASE.md checklist compliance for all versions including patches

**Updated**
- Updated dependencies (`itoa`, `unicode-segmentation`)

## 1.10.1 — 2026-03-23

**Fixed**
- **Parent shell self-matching**: Name-based searches (`proc by`, `proc on <name>`, `proc tree <name>`) no longer match the parent shell process whose command line contains proc's own arguments. Previously, `proc on :99999 --json` would match the shell running proc instead of returning "not found". Now correctly returns exit code 2 with a JSON error

## 1.10.0 — 2026-03-23

**Added**
- **JSON error envelope**: With `--json`, errors now output `{"success":false, "error":"...", "exit_code":N}` to stdout instead of plain text to stderr — enables reliable machine parsing by LLMs and scripts
- **Agent Skills**: `skills/proc-cli/SKILL.md` — Claude Code skill for process management with proc. Includes structured command reference, JSON output schemas, and LLM usage guidelines. Compatible with the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard

## 1.9.1 — 2026-03-16

**Fixed**
- **Windows build**: Gate unix-only imports behind `#[cfg(unix)]` in `freeze.rs` and `thaw.rs` — fixes unused import errors with `-D warnings` on Windows CI

## 1.9.0 — 2026-03-16

**Added**
- **`proc freeze`**: Pause processes with SIGSTOP
  - `proc freeze node` — freeze all node processes
  - `proc freeze :3000 --yes` — freeze by port, skip confirmation
  - Supports `--in`, `--by`, `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--verbose`
- **`proc thaw`**: Resume frozen processes with SIGCONT
  - `proc thaw node` — resume all frozen node processes
  - `proc thaw :3000` — resume process on port 3000
  - Supports `--in`, `--by`, `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--verbose`
- **`proc orphans`**: Find orphaned processes (parent exited, reparented to init/launchd)
  - `proc orphans` — list orphaned processes
  - `proc orphans --in .` — orphans in current directory
  - `proc orphans --kill --yes` — find and kill orphans
  - Filters out system daemons on both macOS and Linux
- **`proc why`**: Trace why a port is busy or show process ancestry
  - `proc why :3000` — ancestry chain with port context
  - `proc why node` — how was this node process started?
  - Shows working directory and command for the target process
  - Full JSON output support
- **`proc free`**: Free ports by killing the process and verifying availability
  - `proc free :3000` — kill process, verify port freed
  - `proc free :3000,:8080 --yes` — free multiple ports
  - `proc free :3000 --wait 30` — wait up to 30s for port to free
  - Reports per-port success/failure (handles TIME_WAIT)
  - Port-only targets; rejects PIDs/names with clear error message
- **`--signal` flag on `proc stop`**: Send custom initial signal instead of SIGTERM
  - `proc stop nginx --signal HUP` — reload config (SIGHUP)
  - `proc stop worker --signal USR1` — application-defined signal
  - Accepts signal names: HUP, INT, QUIT, ABRT, KILL, TERM, STOP, CONT, USR1, USR2

**Changed**
- **Core**: Added `Process::send_signal()` for arbitrary Unix signal delivery
- **Core**: Added `Process::find_orphans()` for orphan detection with system process filtering

**Updated**
- Updated dependencies (`clap`, `sysinfo`, `libc`, `tempfile`, and others)

## 1.8.1 — 2026-03-06

**Fixed**
- README demo image: use absolute URL so it renders on Docker Hub, crates.io, and npm

**Added**
- GitHub Pages blog with 7 technical posts
- Install page with all platforms, shell completions, and man page setup
- Blog redesign: terminal editorial theme with syntax highlighting and SEO meta tags

## 1.8.0 — 2026-03-06

**Added**
- `proc watch`: real-time process monitoring with auto-refresh
  - aliases: `proc top`, `proc w`
  - configurable interval (`-n`), sort (`-s`), limit (`-l`)
  - combines with `--in`, `--by`, `--min-cpu`, `--min-mem`
  - alternate screen with clean terminal restore on exit
  - NDJSON output (`--json`) for streaming
  - non-TTY detection: single snapshot when piped

**Fixed**
- multi-target "not found" output consolidated into single warning

## 1.7.4 — 2026-03-01

**Fixed**
- self-exclusion: proc no longer shows itself in results

## 1.7.3 — 2026-02-26

**Added**
- working directory in output: see which project folder a process runs from

**Changed**
- table `PATH` column replaced with `DIR` (working directory)
