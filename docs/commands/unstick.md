Try to recover stuck processes before resorting to killing. Alias: `u`.

Sends SIGCONT then SIGINT recovery sequence. Use `--force` to terminate if recovery fails.

```bash
proc unstick               # recover all stuck processes
proc unstick node          # recover stuck node processes
proc unstick 1234 :3000    # recover several targets
proc unstick --force       # terminate if recovery fails
```

Several targets are separate arguments. Comma-separated lists (`1234,:3000`) still work but are deprecated.

## Options

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--timeout <secs>` | `-t` | Without a target: only stuck processes running longer than this (default: 300) |
| `--force` | `-f` | Terminate if recovery fails |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |
| `--dry-run` | | Show what would be done |
| `--in [<dir>]` | `-i` | Filter by directory. Takes the next word as its directory unless it starts with `-` (bare `--in` is the current directory, `--in=DIR` is explicit) |
| `--by <name>` | `-b` | Filter by process name (the whole name, ignoring case) |
| `--cmd` | | Match name targets and `--by` as a substring of the process name or full command line (like `pkill -f`) |
| `--json` | `-j` | Output as JSON |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Show extra details |

## Examples

```bash
# try to recover all stuck processes
proc unstick

# recover specific process
proc unstick 1234

# force kill if recovery fails
proc unstick node --force

# preview actions without executing
proc unstick --dry-run
```
